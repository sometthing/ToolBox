This ToolBox was created by project for my CyberSecurity vulnerability and networking knowledge. I want to share my tools with those who what to learn vulnerabilities and networking for CyberSecurity.
I study from W3School | Programming Hub | Sololearn thanks to them now I know networking and a lot of other stuff like Ethical Hacker. Python. Networking. Vulnerabilities and more.

wifite and wifi_own must be used on Linux.
Linux is OS (operating system) that can be installed on Windows and MAC (I am not sure about MAC).

# INSTALLATION
#<<<<<<>>>>>>#
1. Make sure that you have python3 on your device
Phones - Install Termux and then type: pkg install python3
Linux - Open the terminal and type: apt install python3
Windows - I use Windows10 so if this is not working for you then I am sorry. Go to https://www.python.org and download the last version (when I make my tools the version was Python 3.9.6). After you download python3 start the setup and click on Add path, then continue installing with default settings. After you installed python3 open your CMD (Comand Prompt) by clicking on the searching button and type cmd. then type python --version this will show you the version of the python that you have if not then you have a problem with the setup. Watch a video on YouTube on how to fix it. After everything is done you are ready to start the tools. I recommended installing Visual Studio Code for a text editor.

2. You must install packages so the tools can work
First navigate to where you downloaded the tools then type: cd path the path is where are the tools on your device.
Termux - pkg install -r packages
Linux - sudo apt install -r packages
Windows - pip install -r packages
if you don't have pip command then watch a YouTube video for how to fix it.
3. Start the tools
Windows - Open cmd and type: cd path / python toolname | toolname is the name of the tool that you want to start.
Linux - Open the terminal and type: cd path / sudo python3 toolname
Termux - cd path / chmod +x toolname / python3 toolname (that should work if not then find a way that works).

For any errors try to find a way to solve them or wait for new updates.

# How nukeD works?
1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create one application (no mater what is the name).
2. Click on the application that you created.
3. Go to Bot and click PRESENCE INTENT / SERVER MEMBERS INTENT and Administrator
4. Go to OAuth2 and click on bot and then on Administrator
5. Copy this link (this is the link to invite this bot to a server) and paste it in your search bot (google) DON'T click ENTER yet.
6. Go to Bot again and copy the TOKEN and paste it into the nukeD token = "token here" paste the token where it says token here (it shuld look like that: token = "Yg76gy6tVYGi6tC6YR3aUiGFCRuTyvgF6TyVUIvBY65G67iH767").
7. Go to where you pasted the URL and press Enter
8. Choose a server to attack
9. Give Administrator permissions (or it will not work)
10. After the bot is in the server you can start the nukeD by typing: cd nukeDpath / python nukeD.py | nukeDpath is where nukeD is at your devise. For Linux and Termux type: Termux: chmod +x nukeD.py / python3 nukeD.py | Linux: sudo python3 nukeD.py
11. Go to discord server and type: $nuke | to strat the nuke / to stop the nuke type: $stoppp
